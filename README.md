# RF-Classifier-Trading-Strategy

Greetings!:)
I am currently working on using a machine learning algorithm (Random Forest Classifier) to predict some buy/sell signals in day tradings
In this exercise, a very well-known and easy trading strategy "Golden Cross" will be implemented

Golden Cross:
if MA(t_1) cross MA(t_2), it can be viewed as a bullish sign, where t_1 < t_2.
