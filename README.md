# RF-Classifier-Trading-Strategy

Greetings!:)

I am currently working on using a machine learning algorithm (Random Forest Classifier) to predict some buy/sell signals in day tradings.
In this exercise, a very well-known and easy trading strategy "Golden Cross" will be implemented

Golden Cross Strategy:  
if MA(t1) crosses MA(t2), it can be viewed as a bullish sign, where t1 < t2.
